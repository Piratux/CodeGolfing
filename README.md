# CodeGolfing
A collection of my code golfing solutions.

## Code Golf?
Code golf is the art of coming up with code that solves a challenge while making the length of code (usually counted in bytes) as small as possible.

## Tell me more
Over the years, I've participated in multiple code golfing challenges in One Lone Coder (OLC) discord server. So I've decided that, I would like to accumulate my solutions in a single place. And that place is this repository.

I mainly use C language for code golf as I consider it the most fun. But I also occasionally use C++, Lua and Python.

## Great websites
Here is a list of websites, that I consider worthy of checking out related to code golf:
- Exchange code golf challenges, solutions and tips:
    - https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/
- Submit code golf solutions online in language of your choice and get feedback immediately. As a bonus, it has code golf tips for each language, leaderboards, achievements and more.
