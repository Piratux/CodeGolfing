# CodeGolfing
A collection of my code golfing solutions.

## Code Golf?
Code golf is the art of coming up with code that solves a challenge while making the length of code (usually counted in bytes) as small as possible.

## What can I find here?
Over the years, I've participated in multiple code golfing challenges in One Lone Coder (OLC) discord server. So I've decided that, I would like to accumulate my solutions in a single place for future reference. And that place is this repository.

## What do you wield?
I mainly use C language for code golf as I consider it the most fun. But I also occasionally use C++, Lua and Python.

For actively developing a golfed solution, I prefer [Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/). For sharing final solution, I mainly use [ideone](https://ideone.com/) or Godbolt.

## Tell me more...
On the last 5 days of 2021, first ever 5-day Golf With Gorbit code golfing event was hosted in the OLC server. As curious and excited as I was, I decided to give myself a go at it. In the event, each day for 5 days, a new code golf challenge would appear for which participants had 24 hours to make a submission. After intense 5-day session, I managed to come victorious in 2/5 challenges by crafting shortest solutions in C. Since Gorbit was feeling generous, winners were awarded with Steam game keys. Not knowing what I was getting myself into, I've picked [Factor.io](https://www.factorio.com/). Back then, I didn't play Steam's games, so to reclaim my prize, I had to create Steam account. Fast forward 2 years, and I have racked up 1000 hours on Factor.io and became one of the main developers of [Factor.io pirate ship mod](https://github.com/ComfyFactory/ComfyFactorio). A wild but enjoyable ride that was..
